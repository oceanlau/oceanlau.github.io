> In the end, all things must serve Rome.

## Hoplites (early Roman republic, 578 BC - c. 315 BC)

- Hoplite

  ![Hoplite](/assets/img/Aux_Gre_Hoplites.png)

  Infantry with spears and shields. Often fight in phalanx formation. Originated from Ancient Greek city-states.

- Equites

  ![Equites](/assets/img/Rom_Equites.png)

  Almost the highest rank in the property-based classes of Rome, just below the senatorial class. They served as cavalry.

## Manipular legion (mid Roman republic, 315-107 BC)

### 3 core heavy infantry types

  - Hastati

    ![Hastati](/assets/img/Rom_Hastati.png)

    First line. Poor or young men who could only afford modest armor. Originally wielding a *hasta* (spear). Later supplied with a *gladius* (short stabbing sword), a *scutum* (squared wooden shield), and one or two *pila* (throwing spear).

  - Principes

    Second line. Wealthy men with decent armor. Same weapon as the hastati.

  - Triarii

    Third line. Old and wealthy men with high quality armor. Equipped with spears.

> In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. They were meant to be used as a decisive force in the battle, thus prompting the old Roman saying, 'it comes down to the triarii', which meant carrying on to the bitter end.

### Support types

  - Velites

    ![Velites](/assets/img/Rom_Velites.png)

    Front line light infantry and skirmisher. Youngest and poorest with no armor. Equipped with darts (javelin), a *gladius* and a *parma* (small wooden shield). Descended from earlier class of Leves.

  - Equites

  - Rorarii

    ![Rorarii](/assets/img/Rom_Rorarii.png)

    Final line reserve infantry. Usually the poorest with no much fighting capabilities.

  - Socii and Latini

    ![Socii and Latini](/assets/img/Aux_Ita_Socii_Hastati.png)

    Troop from allied states in Italy.

### Manipular legion

A legion consisted of 10 maniples of 120 hastati, 10 maniples of 120 principes and 10 half strength maniples of triarii containing 60 men each. With 1,200 velites and 300 cavalrymen a legion numbered 4,500 men. However, in times of great need the number might be reinforced up to 5,000.

## Marian legion (late Roman republic, 107-27 BC)

Roman consul Gaius Marius carried out a programme of reform known as Marian reforms. From seasoned conscripts to voluntary or professional army. All citizens were eligible into the legion now regardless of wealth or social class.

- Legionary

  ![Legionary](/assets/img/Rom_Legionaries.png)

  All classes of heavy infantry are formed into one homogeneous type.

- Evocatus

  ![Evocatus](/assets/img/Rom_Evocati_Cohort.png)

  Soldiers who had served out their time and obtained honorable discharges (honesta missio) but had voluntarily enlisted again at the invitation of the consul or other commander.

- Auxilia: The roles of missile and cavalry support are fullfiled by non-citizen auxiliaries. 

### Marian legion

A legion consisted of 10 cohorts. A cohort composed of 480 soldiers. A cohort consisted of 6 centuriae each commanded by a centurion.

Each legion was partnered with an approximately equal number of auxiliae troops.

## Imperial legions (Imperial Roman, 27 BC - 117 AD)

The structure remains the same. But more non-roman enter the legion and more professional armies.

- Praetorian Guard
