## Manipular legion (early Roman republic, 315-107 BC)

### 3 core heavy infantry types

  - Hastati: First line. Poor or young men who could only afford modest armor. Originally wielding a *hasta* (spear). Later supplied with a *gladius* (short stabbing sword), a *scutum* (squared wooden shield), and one or two *pila* (throwing spear).
  - Principes: Second line. Wealthy men with decent armor. Same weapon as the hastati.
  - Triarii: Third line. Old and wealthy men with high quality armor. Equipped with spears.

> res ad triairos venit
> In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. They were meant to be used as a decisive force in the battle, thus prompting the old Roman saying, 'it comes down to the triarii', which meant carrying on to the bitter end.

### Support types

  - Velites: Front line light infantry and skirmisher. Youngest and poorest with no armor. Equipped with darts (javelin), a *gladius* and a *parma* (small wooden shield). Descended from earlier class of Leves.
  - Equites: They are almost the highest rank in the property-based classes of Rome, just below the senatorial class. They are the cavalry in the legion.
  - Roraii: Final line reserve infantry. Usually the poorest with no much fighting capabilities.
  - Socii and Latini: Troop from allied states in Italy.

### Manipular legion

A legion consisted of 10 maniples of 120 hastati, 10 maniples of 120 principes and 10 half strength maniples of triarii containing 60 men each. With 1,200 velites and 300 cavalrymen a legion numbered 4,500 men. However, in times of great need the number might be reinforced up to 5,000.
