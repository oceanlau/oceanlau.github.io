From my childhood I love paper and notebook. I collected newspaper and those torn yellow paper. I think putting a lot of things down and filled them up would make me wise and knowledgeable. Now I still have 12 notebooks with me in my college. One for random notes, one for English words, one for English sentences, one for programming language notes, one for article cuts, one for reading notes, one for my thoughts on articles/music/games/movies, one for hand-draw site design, one for my review on others’ sites, one for my game design, and even one for my random game idea.

I hadn’t touched these notebooks since I got my laptop ( one notebook rules all ). I was thinking all these notebooks had been pulling my leg for 10 years maybe. They are not functioning at all now.

But then I remembered the good old days, when I was learning and satisfied everyday. May be it is me that is not functioning properly now.
