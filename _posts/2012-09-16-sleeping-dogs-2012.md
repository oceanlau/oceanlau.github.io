The best GTA-like sandbox game ever!

# The Good

Graphic, especially the road light reflection in the rain. It’s amazingly good.

Character Action, including the fist fight. The motion capture is great.

Story background and environment are close to reality.

Improved mission system then GTA.

Great UI.

# The Bad

It’s a sandbox game. That meant every good is a repetitive in the end. So I didn’t finish the game. Though the Infernal-Affairs-liked story seems interesting at first.
