一部感觉上像《无耻混蛋》的电影，不过比它更嘻哈，更搞人。总之是部有特色的电影，有些地方语出惊人，让人印象深刻。

Boris The Blade, or Boris The Bullet-Dodger. Bent as the Soviet sickle and hard as the hammer that crosses it.

Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.（别拍马屁）

下面是Brick Top的犀利教学：

Hope this is not a bad moment.

You’re always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. Apparently, the best thing to do is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together.

When you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them. It’s no good leaving it in the freezer for your mum to discover. Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs. You gotta starve the pigs for a few days then the chopped-up body will look like curry to a pisshead. You gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out for the piggies’ digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course but you don’t want to sieve through pigshit, do you? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least 16 pigs to finish the job in one sitting so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes.That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression “as greedy as a pig.”
