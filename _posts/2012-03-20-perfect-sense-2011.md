> The greater loss are all the memories that are no longer triggered.  
> Smell and memory were connected in the brain.  
> Cinnamon might have reminded you of your grandmother’s apron.  
> The scent of cut hay could evoke a childhood fear of cows.  
> Diesel oil might bring back memories of your first ferry crossing.  
> Without smell, an ocean of past images disappears.
